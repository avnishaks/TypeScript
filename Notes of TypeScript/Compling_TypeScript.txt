In order to compile the TypeScript code 


1. Browser does not support the TypeScript , so to run the TypeScript code we need to 
compile the TypeScript code into the JavaScript code.

2. tsc {typeScript file name} {javascript file name}

if the file name of the TypeScript and JavaScript is same then we should avoid it.
