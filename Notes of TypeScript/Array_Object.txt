Array :- 

In typescript  , when we declare the array , if its of the type string , then we only
pushed the string value , same goes for integers or numbers. If our array is of type 
mixed with string and number is declared , then we can manipulate and push the string and
number value.


Object :- 

Once we declare the object , the object type then we can manipulate or changed it , we can't add 
more key value pairs to the object.
