Some points releared to BetterWorkFlow_TsConfig

1. Make two folder public and src , public includes the folder of html , csss ,
 javascript and src contains the typescript files only.

2. Make the changes in the tsConfig file for the rootDir and outDir as "./src" or "./public" , to 
create tsConfig.json using "tsc -init"

3. To include only src folder use "include"=[].

4. When we create the typescript files in src folder , then automatically javascript file is created
in the public folder.
